1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
-It helps to find the bug easily and in a shorter time than opening both files and seraching for the bug line by line.

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-When you have easy access to the entire history of a file, you don't have to worry about the remembering what you've done before when you make a mistake.
You can go back and see your steps and can easily change the wrong parts.
Also it helps to see your improvement easily.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-Both pros and cons are related to the user. The user the one who knows the codes best and know when to commit her changes. But user can forget the commit changes or cannot commit changes
when she has to commit

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-Because Git is designed for version control of the codes. And one change of code in a file can effect the other files.

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-"git log" is for the list of the commits and "git diff" is for the changes between two commits(added and deleted lines).

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-Because you don't need to worry about making mistakes, you can go back whenever you want and see what causes the problem.

7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-I want to use Git for my projects.
